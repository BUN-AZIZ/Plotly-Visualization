# Introduction to Visualization using Plotly

Plotly is a powerful and flexible tool for creating interactive visualizations that can be embedded in web applications, notebooks, or standalone web pages. It allows users to generate a wide variety of visualizations, including line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, 3D plots, and more. Plotly supports multiple programming languages such as Python, R, and JavaScript, making it versatile and widely used among data scientists, analysts, and developers. Its ability to produce interactive charts with relatively simple code makes it popular for exploratory data analysis and data presentation.

To run Plotly and create interactive visualizations, you'll need the following:

- [x] Programming Language: Plotly supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and JavaScript. You need to have a working knowledge of one of these languages to use Plotly effectively.

- [x] Plotly Library: For Python and R, you'll need to install the Plotly library to your programming environment. You can do this using package managers like pip (for Python) or CRAN (for R). For JavaScript, you can include the Plotly library through a CDN or by downloading the required JavaScript files.

- [x] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Text Editor: You'll need a code editor or IDE where you can write and execute your Plotly code. Popular choices include Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, RStudio, etc.

- [x] Web Browser: Plotly visualizations are rendered in web browsers, so you need a modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to view and interact with the plots.

- [x] **For this python example specifically, we will install Pandas. Using Pandas is often helpful to preprocess and prepare data before visualizing it with Plotly**
